Richard's instructions from slack (10/3/25)

- The evolution notebook is in [evo.ipynb](https://github.com/rdebrand/pdffit/blob/main/examples/evolution/evo.ipynb)
- The corresponding fk and cs data is also in the repo

To run the notebook (need to install eko and pineappl, nnpdf fk packages), i think its both pip though, best though in a new venv as they only take some old numpys as far as i recall)
well it might be a bit tricky to get it to work then, i dont know if you want to invest that time
